Week 13 of GSoC is here and I am **in London for [JuliaCon 2018](http://juliacon.org/2018/)**! ðŸ˜Ž

Four days jam-packed with workshops about every aspect of Julia, plus talks and keynotes from Julia developers, university professors, and other prominent industry representatives. And an additional hackathon day at the [Microsoft Reactor](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/), what more can one ask for!?

I am very excited to be attending this event, and I thank NumFOCUS and the Julia organization once again for sponsoring me (and other GSoC students!) to attend this event.
Without your sponsorship, I wouldn't be able to afford this trip to London!!

As part of the sponsorship terms, I'll also be presenting a poster that summarizes some of the work I did during my GSoC project this year. I guess it's not a bad deal ðŸ˜…... Come by and check my poster out!

<sup>(I worked on [`Makie.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/), for those of you that haven't been following my blog and just stumbled randomly upon this post ðŸ˜‰).

I won't post the poster here (yet) because I don't want to spoil the surprise for those that come in person. But I will upload it, once I have presented it ðŸ˜€.

For those of you that are coming to JuliaCon, let me know!
Would be great to meet you in person, find out about what you're working on, and talk all things Julia!

See you soon (<sub><sup>in 5 hours yay</sup></sub>)!
