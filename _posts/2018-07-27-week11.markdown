Week 11 of GSoC is **done**! üéâüò∏üíª
<sub><sup>Phew, it's been a while since the last update!</sup></sub>

The following is a progress report since the last post.

#### Milestones -- `Makie.jl` and `AbstractPlotting.jl`
* continually updated [`Makie`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/) and [`AbstractPlotting`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl) packages, bringing updates and improvements to documentation and additional tutorials.
* extension of the `Documenter.Selectors.matcher` and `Documenter.Selectors.runner` to match custom-defined keywords using regex, and [perform actions based on the match captures](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/blob/aw/documentation/docs/documenter_extension.jl)
	* as an example you can now write `@example_database("Contour3d")` in the `documentation.md` source Markdown file, and during compile, the source code + the plot of the example will be automatically inserted
	* likewise, `@example_database("Contour3d", code)` inserts only the source code, and
	* `@example_database("Contour3d", plot)` inserts only the plot <sup><sup>(oh, the magic of regex üòç)</sup></sup>
* implementation of a `Stepper` class that allows one to `step!` through example plots, and save a plot at each `step`
```julia
	mutable struct Stepper
		  scene::Scene
		  folder::String
		  step::Int
	end

	function step!(s::Stepper)
	    Makie.save(joinpath(s.folder, basename(s.folder) * "-$(s.step).jpg"), s.scene)
	    s.step += 1
	    return s
	end
```
* these `stepper` examples are great for showing off progressive changes in plots, such as demonstrating the effects of theming or changing data:

* the `stepper` examples are automatically generated when compiling the documentation, and inserted on the fly
	* as above, we can also write `@example_database("Theming", stepperplot)` in the `documentation.md` to insert stepper plots automatically
* for some more stepper examples, consult the `Makie` documentation, which is [available online!](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/)

#### Mergers (& Acquisitions)
* two PRs to branch `master` on `AbstractPlotting` mergedüéâ! [#2](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl/pull/2), [#4](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl/pull/4).
* three major PRs to branch `master` on `Makie` containing many documentation changes are mergedüéâ!! They are: [#99](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/pull/99), [#111](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/pull/111), and [#114](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/pull/114).
* AND... the Gitlab CI pipeline for visual regression tests actually passed, **for once**!

![The chances of this happening are like 1 in 1E200]({{site.url}}/gsoc_blog/assets/img/gitlab-pipeline-pass.png)

<sub><sup>The "failed" status with the documentation postprocessing step is due to a missing package on the CI, and should be fixed soon.</sup></sub>

* I also implemented some subscenes examples, e.g.:

`surface` + `contour3d` plot

![Subscenes contour]({{site.url}}/gsoc_blog/assets/img/subscenes-contour.jpg)

`surface` + `wireframe` + `contour` plot

![Subscenes surface + wireframe + contour]({{site.url}}/gsoc_blog/assets/img/surface_wireframe_contour.jpg)

Check these examples out in the [`examples3d.jl` library](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/blob/aw/documentation/examples/examples3d.jl)!

#### One more thing...
* I started exploring some implicit plots, and plots involving inequalities, these generate some pretty interesting-looking plots:

![the biohazard]({{site.url}}/gsoc_blog/assets/img/biohazard.jpg)

And lastly... a spacecraft from a galaxy far, far away

These examples are saved in the [`implicits.jl` library](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/blob/aw/documentation/examples/implicits.jl), so feel free to check them out! üòÄ‚òù


#### TODOs
* add more documentation pages, including proper documentation of the `Stepper` class
* making a poster for [JuliaCon 2018](http://juliacon.org/2018/) in London, UK, which is in 11 days! I will be attending and presenting a poster as part of my GSoC project under the Julia organization, along with a few other GSoC students. Huge thanks to NumFOCUS for sponsoring us!!


So, that's it! Hope you enjoyed reading this. Onwards to the [last 10 days of coding üë®‚Äçüíª](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline)!
